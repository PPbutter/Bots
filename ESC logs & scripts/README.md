# ESC Diagnostics & Scripts Folder

This folder contains diagnostic tools and scripts related to the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) used in the robot. These files help ensure that the ESCs are functioning correctly, providing accurate control over the motors, and are properly calibrated.

## Contents

- **ESC Diagnostic Scripts**: Scripts for running tests on the ESCs to verify their performance and detect any issues with motor control, speed regulation, or signal input.
- **ESC Calibration Tools**: Scripts and documentation to assist with the calibration of the ESCs, ensuring they are configured correctly for the motors in use and that the throttle range is properly set.
- **Error Logs**: Files that store diagnostic output or logs from ESC tests, highlighting any errors, faults, or performance anomalies.
- **ESC Configuration Files**: Configuration files containing specific settings or parameters for the ESCs, such as motor timing, braking, and acceleration curves.
- **User Guides & Instructions**: Documentation outlining how to use the diagnostic scripts, calibrate ESCs, and interpret test results for troubleshooting purposes.

## Usage

Use the diagnostic scripts to routinely test and calibrate the ESCs for optimal performance. In the event of motor issues or irregularities, refer to the error logs and rerun the diagnostics. Ensure that any modifications to the scripts or ESC settings are documented and saved in this folder.

## Guidelines

- Run diagnostics regularly to maintain ESC performance.
- Use the calibration tools before installing new motors or ESCs.
- Save and review error logs after each test for troubleshooting.
- Keep all scripts well-documented and up to date.
