# Hempfield Robotics Team Repository

Welcome to the Hempfield Robotics Team's official GitHub repository! This repository serves as the central hub for all files, designs, and documentation related to our robotics projects. It contains everything from 3D models to schematics and circuit designs that are crucial for building and programming our robot.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into several key folders to help structure our work:

- **Inventor Files**: Contains Autodesk Inventor files, including 3D models, assemblies, and technical drawings of the robot's components and systems.
- **Schematics**: Includes architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and system designs that map out the structure and operation of the robot.
- **Circuits**: Holds electrical circuit designs, wiring diagrams, and documentation for the robot's electronics and control systems.
- **Code**: Source code for controlling the robot, including programming for ESC, actuators, and autonomous or Remote Control operations.

## Contributions

Team members are encouraged to regularly update this repository with their work to keep it in sync with ongoing developments. Please ensure that all files are named appropriately and organized in the correct folders. Any updates to schematics, models, or circuits should also be reflected in the documentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the relevant files in the **Inventor Files**, **Schematics**, and **Circuit Diagrams** folders to familiarize yourself with the current designs.
3. If working on code, navigate to the **Code** folder for the latest updates on the robot's software.
4. Make sure to commit and push changes frequently to keep the repository up to date.

## Contact

For any questions or assistance, reach out to one of the team leads or post an issue on the repository.
