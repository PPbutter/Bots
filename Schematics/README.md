# Schematics Folder

This folder contains all the project schematics, including diagrams, flowcharts, and system designs. These schematics serve as a visual reference for understanding the architecture and design of the project.

## Contents

- **Architecture Diagrams**: High-level diagrams that outline the overall structure and components of the system.
- **Flowcharts**: Step-by-step visual representations of processes and workflows within the project.
- **ER Diagrams**: Entity-Relationship diagrams depicting the database schema and relationships between entities.
- **Component Diagrams**: Detailed designs of individual components or subsystems within the project.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: A list of all the components required for the circuits, including part numbers, specifications, and suppliers.

## Usage

Each schematic is named according to its relevant module or feature. Refer to these files when developing or reviewing the system architecture. Any updates to the design should be reflected in this folder and documented accordingly.
