# Circuits Folder

This folder contains all the electrical circuit designs and documentation crucial for the robot's control systems and power distribution. These files ensure the correct wiring and functioning of sensors, motors, controllers, and other electrical components.

## Contents

- **Circuit Diagrams**: Detailed wiring diagrams showing the connections between the various electronic components of the robot (motors, sensors, controllers, etc.).
- **PCB Layouts**: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs for any custom electronics used in the robot.
- **Power Distribution**: Schematics and documentation related to the power supply and distribution for the robot, including voltage regulators and battery connections.
- **Sensor and Actuator Schematics**: Diagrams showing how sensors and actuators are integrated into the circuit, including pinouts and wiring details.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: A list of all the components required for the circuits, including part numbers, specifications, and suppliers.

## Usage

These circuit files are essential for understanding and assembling the robot's electronic systems. Team members can refer to these diagrams for guidance during the building and troubleshooting processes. Any changes to the circuits should be updated here, and team members should ensure the latest version is always documented.

## Guidelines

- Keep the circuit designs updated and properly labeled.
- Ensure all connections, components, and power sources are clearly depicted.
- Use standard file formats (.pdf, .sch, .brd, etc.) for compatibility.
